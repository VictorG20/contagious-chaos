# Contagious chaos
Second Project for Advanced Computational Physics

* The SIR Preliminaries notebook was made to create plots for explaining certain aspects of the behavior of the model *before actually solving the exercise*
* The notebook 1b extras creates plots to display the behavior of solutions of the SIRS model at different values of the basic reproduction number.

* Note: Technically all notebooks should work right out of the box and for arbitrary values (but sensible, so the system can be solved).
